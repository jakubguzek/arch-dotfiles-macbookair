Dotfiles of my newbie Arch Linux rice. I do not keep all of my configs
in this repo, but you can find most of them here.

General information
===================

-   **OS:** [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
-   **Window Manager:** [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
    [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
-   **Terminal emulator:** [st](https://st.suckless.org/)
-   **Shell:** Mainly bash
-   **Text editor/ISE:**
    [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)/[Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
-   **File Manager:** [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

My configuration of dwm can be found in [dedicated
repository](https://github.com/jakubguzek/dwm). I didn’t included the
build of st that I use as it’s not mine but cloned from
[here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st).

In folder .config/colorthemes you can find colorthemes for .Xresources
that I use. I apply them dynamically-ish using my custom
[theme](https://github.com/jakubguzek/arch.dotfiles/blob/master/.local/bin/theme)
script.

Custom scripts
==============

My custom scripts for various things are located in .local/bin. Their
somewhat sloppy documentation is located in .local/bin/man.
