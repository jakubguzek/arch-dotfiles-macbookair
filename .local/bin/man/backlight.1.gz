.SH DESCRIPTION
.B backlight
is a small script that changes or prints the current value of backlight brightness by accessing the files in
.IR /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/
or
.I /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/
It is then essential that at least files:
.I brightness
and
.I max_brightness
in those locations be writeable for script to work. This can be achieved by setting
.I udev
rules that change the ownership or group privileges for those files.
