Usage: backlight [ -hmps ] [ --inc value ] [ --dec value ]
backlight is a small script that changes or prints the current value of
 backlight brightness by reading and writing to files in
/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/ or /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/.

Options:
	-h, --help		Print this help message
	-m			Print the maximal value of backlight brightness
	-p 			Print the current value of backlight brightness in percent
	-s 			Print the current value of backlight brightness
	    --inc value 	Increase the current value of backlight brightness by
 value. If the increased value would exceed the maximal value then maximal
 value is set instead.
	    --dec value		Decrease the current value of backlight brightness by
 value. If the decreased value would be less than or equal to zero then
 1 is set instead.

Value for --inc and --dec options must be a positive integer and cannot be empty.
